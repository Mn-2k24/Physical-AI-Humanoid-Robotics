  abstract = {This paper presents a new software framework for HRI experimentation with the sixth version of the common NAO robot produced by the United Robotics Group. Embracing the common demand of researchers for better performance and new features for NAO, the authors took advantage of the ability to run ROS2 onboard on the NAO to develop a framework independent of the APIs provided by the manufacturer. Such a system provides NAO with not only the basic skills of a humanoid robot such as walking and reproducing movements of interest but also features often used in HRI such as: speech recognition/synthesis, face and object detention, and the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models for conversation. The developed code is therefore configured as a ready-to-use but also highly expandable and improvable tool thanks to the possibilities provided by the ROS community.},

  abstract = {Humanoid robots are complex, dynamic systems. Any humanoid robotic application starts with determining a sequence of optimal paths to perform a given task in a known or unknown environment. This paper critically reviews and rates available literature on the three key areas of multi-level motion and task planning for humanoid robots. First is efficiency while navigating and manipulating objects in environments designed for humans. Here, the research has broadly been summarized as behavior cloning approaches. Second is robustness to perturbations and collisions caused by operation in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Here, the modeling approaches integrated into motion planning algorithms have been the focus of many researchers studying humanoid motion's balance and dynamic stability aspects. Last is real-time performance, wherein the robot must adjust its motion based on the most recent sensory data to achieve the required degree of interaction and responsiveness. Here, the focus has been on the kinematic constraints imposed by the robot's mechanical structure and joint movements. The iterative nature of solving constrained optimization problems, the computational complexity of forward and inverse kinematics, and the requirement to adjust to a rapidly changing environment all pose challenges to real-time performance. The study has identified current trends and, more importantly, research gaps while pointing to areas needing further investigation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the technical specifications of a lightweight humanoid robot platform named Robinion Sr. including its mechanical and electrical design. We describe a versatile and robust mechatronic system, efficient walking gait, and software architecture of the humanoid robot. The humanoid robot platform is targeted for use in a range of applications, including research and development, competitions, and the service industry. A reduced platform cost was an essential consideration in our design. We introduce a specialized and inexpensive mechanical design, which includes a parallel-kinematics leg design, external gears, and low-cost controllers and sensors. The humanoid robot is equipped with an efficient electronic structure and a tablet computer for task scheduling, control, and perception, as well as an embedded controller for solving forward \& inverse kinematics and low-level actuator control. The perception system recognizes objects at real-time inference with Deep Learning-based detection algorithms without a dedicated GPU. We present and evaluate the capabilities of our newly developed advanced humanoid robot and believe it is a suitable platform for the academic and industrial robotics community.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces SMARTmBOT, an opensource mobile robot platform based on Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). The characteristics of the SMARTmBOT, including low-cost, modular-typed, customizable and expandable design, make it an easily achievable and effective robot platform to support broad robotics research and education involving either single-robot or multi-robot systems. The total cost per robot is approximately \$210, and most hardware components can be fabricated by a generic 3D printer, hence allowing users to build the robots or replace any broken parts conveniently. The SMARTmBot is also equipped with a rich range of sensors, making it competent for general task scenarios, such as pointto-point navigation and obstacle avoidance. We validated the mobility and function of SMARTmBOT through various robot navigation experiments and applications with tasks including go-to-goal, pure-pursuit, line following, and swarming. All source code necessary for reading sensors, streaming from an embedded camera, and controlling the robot including robot navigation controllers is available through an online repository that can be found at https://github.com/ SMARTlab-Purdue/SMARTmBOT.},

This work introduces the PIC4rl-gym, a fundamental modular framework to enhance navigation and learning research by mixing ROS2 and Gazebo, the standard tools of the robotics community, with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper describes the whole structure of the PIC4rl-gym, which fully integrates DRL agent's training and testing in several indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios and tasks. A modular approach is adopted to easily customize the simulation by selecting new platforms, sensors, or models. We demonstrate the potential of our novel gym by benchmarking the resulting policies, trained for different navigation tasks, with a complete set of metrics.},
