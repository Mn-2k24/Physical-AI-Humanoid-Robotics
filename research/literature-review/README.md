# Literature Review Documentation

Comprehensive literature reviews for each module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

## Review Files

1. **module-1-ros2.md** - ROS 2 middleware, DDS, communication patterns
2. **module-2-simulation.md** - Gazebo, Unity, physics engines, sim-to-real
3. **module-3-isaac.md** - NVIDIA Isaac Sim/ROS, synthetic data, GPU acceleration
4. **module-4-vla.md** - Vision-Language-Action models, embodied AI, cognitive planning

## Review Template

Each literature review should follow this structure:

### 1. Overview
- Scope and objectives
- Key research questions
- Relevance to book module

### 2. Foundational Work (Pre-2020)
- Seminal papers that established the field
- Classic algorithms and methods
- Theoretical frameworks

### 3. Recent Advances (2020-2025)
- State-of-the-art methods
- Emerging trends
- Novel applications

### 4. Key Findings by Topic
Organize by subtopics relevant to the module:
- Topic A: Summary, key papers, insights
- Topic B: Summary, key papers, insights
- ...

### 5. Research Gaps & Opportunities
- Underexplored areas
- Contradictory findings
- Future directions

### 6. Implications for Book
- How research informs chapter content
- Practical applications for tutorials
- Recommended citations for technical depth

### 7. Bibliography
- Organized list of all cited papers (alphabetical)
- Include DOI/arXiv links

## Citation Guidelines

- **Peer-reviewed papers**: Prioritize for theoretical claims (target: 50%+ of citations)
- **Technical reports**: NVIDIA, Google, OpenAI whitepapers for implementation details
- **Documentation**: Official ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac docs for setup/configuration
- **Preprints**: arXiv for cutting-edge research (clearly mark as preprint)

## Research Workflow

1. **Search Phase**: Use Google Scholar, arXiv, conference proceedings
2. **Screening**: Read abstracts, filter by relevance
3. **Deep Reading**: Full paper analysis, create notes in `research/notes/`
4. **Synthesis**: Write literature review connecting papers
5. **Integration**: Cite papers in book chapters via `references.bib`

## Quality Criteria

Each literature review should:
- Cover 15-25 papers per module (mix of seminal + recent)
- Achieve 50%+ peer-reviewed citations (IEEE, ACM, Springer journals/conferences)
- Synthesize findings (not just summarize individual papers)
- Connect research to practical book content
- Identify 2-3 cutting-edge papers for "Further Reading" sections

**Note**: Literature reviews are living documents. Update as new research emerges during book writing.
