# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, you'll learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for modern robots. ROS 2 enables communication between different components of a robot system, from sensors and actuators to AI algorithms and control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Explain how ROS 2 differs from traditional software architectures
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes using Python (`rclpy`)
- Implement communication using topics, services, and actions
- Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Build a basic ROS 2 workspace for humanoid robot control

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the de facto standard for robot middleware, used by:
- Academic research institutions worldwide
- Industry leaders (NASA, BMW, Amazon, Boston Dynamics)
- Open-source robotics community

**Key Features**:
- **Real-time capable**: Critical for responsive robot control
- **Multi-language support**: Python for AI, C++ for performance
- **Distributed systems**: Robots can communicate across networks
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configurable reliability and latency
- **Security**: Built-in authentication and encryption (DDS-Security)

## Module Structure

This module consists of 4 chapters and 1 hands-on tutorial:

### Chapters

1. **Introduction to Physical AI**: Understanding embodied intelligence and why AI in physical systems differs from traditional AI
2. **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Architecture, DDS middleware, and core concepts
3. **Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions**: Communication patterns for distributed robot systems
4. **URDF Robot Models**: Defining humanoid robot structure, joints, and sensors

### Tutorial

- **Tutorial 1: ROS 2 Hello World**: Build your first ROS 2 nodes with publisher/subscriber communication

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic Linux command line knowledge (cd, ls, mkdir, etc.)
- Python programming fundamentals (functions, classes, imports)
- Undergraduate-level mathematics (linear algebra basics helpful but not required)

## Time Commitment

- **Reading**: 6-8 hours total
- **Tutorial**: 30-45 minutes
- **Practice**: 2-4 hours recommended

## Hardware Requirements

For this module, you only need:
- Computer with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or Windows/Mac with Docker/WSL2)
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- No GPU or special hardware required yet
